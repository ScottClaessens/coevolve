\title{Make Stan data for dynamic coevolutionary model}
\usage{
coev_make_standata(data, variables, id, tree, prior = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{An object of class \code{data.frame} (or one that can be coerced
to that class) containing data of all variables used in the model.}

\item{variables}{A named list identifying variables that should coevolve in
the model and their associated response distributions as character strings (e.g.
\code{list(var1 = "bernoulli_logit", var2 = "ordered_logistic")}). Must identify
at least two variables. Variable names must refer to valid column names in data.
Currently, the only supported response distributions are \code{bernoulli_logit}
and \code{ordered_logistic}.}

\item{id}{A character of length one identifying the variable in the data that links rows to tips
on the phylogeny. Must refer to a valid column name in the data. The id column
must exactly match the tip labels in the phylogeny.}

\item{tree}{A phylogenetic tree object of class \code{phylo}.}

\item{prior}{A list of priors for the model.}
}
\value{
A list containing the data for fitting the dynamic coevolutionary model in \pkg{Stan}.
}
