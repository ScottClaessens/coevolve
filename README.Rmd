## Overview

The **coevolve** package allows the user to fit Bayesian dynamic coevolutionary
phylogenetic models in Stan. These models can be used to estimate how variables 
have coevolved over evolutionary time and to assess causal directionality
(X → Y vs. Y → X) and contingencies (X, then Y) in evolution.

While existing methods only allow pairs of binary traits to coevolve
(e.g., [BayesTraits](https://www.evolution.reading.ac.uk/BayesTraitsV4.1.2/BayesTraitsV4.1.2.html)),
the **coevolve** package allows users to include multiple traits of different
data types, including binary, ordinal, count, and continuous traits.

## Installation

To use the **coevolve** package, you must first install the `cmdstanr` package
(see full installation instructions here: https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/).

```{r install_cmdstanr, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("cmdstanr", repos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/", getOption("repos")))
```

You can then install the development version of `coevolve` with:

```{r install_coevolve, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ScottClaessens/coevolve")
```

## Example

We can simulate a phylogenetic tree with some data to see how the package works.
First, simulate a phylogenetic tree.

```{r simulate_tree}
# set the random seed
set.seed(1)
# number of taxa
n <- 10
# random tree
tree <- ape::rcoal(n)
```

Then, simulate data for a binary trait, an ordinal trait, and a count trait.

```{r simulate_data}
# simulate data
d <- 
  data.frame(
    # id to match dataset to tree tips
    id = tree$tip.label,
    # simulate variables
    x = rbinom(n, 1, 0.5),
    y = ordered(sample(1:3, size = n, replace = TRUE)),
    z = rpois(n, 2)
  )

head(d)
```

We can then fit our Bayesian dynamic coevolutionary model in `cmdstanr` with the 
`coev_fit()` function. We declare all variables and set the response distributions
for binary, ordinal, and count variables as `bernoulli_logit`, `ordered_logistic`,
and `poisson_softplus` respectively.

```{r fit_model, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# load the coevolve package
library(coevolve)

# fit model
m <-
  coev_fit(
    data = d,
    variables = list(
      x = "bernoulli_logit",
      y = "ordered_logistic",
      z = "poisson_softplus"
    ),
    id = "id",
    tree = tree,
    # additional arguments for cmdstanr
    parallel_chains = 4,
    refresh = 0,
    seed = 1
  )
```

The results can be investigated using:

```{r fit_summary}
summary(m)
```

From the cross selection effects, we infer that the three traits do not influence 
one another in their evolution.

We can also plot the cross selection effects from this model using the 
`coev_plot_delta_theta()` function.

```{r plot_delta_theta}
coev_plot_delta_theta(m)
```
